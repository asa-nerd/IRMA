Interactive Real-time Measurement of Attention

IRMA (Interactive Real-time Measurement of Attention) is a measuring apparatus designed to investigate performances of audiovisual computer music in situated contexts. It provides devices and software to monitor on which elements or materials the attention of the audience focuses over the course of the performance. The method involves interpretation by collating collected quantitative empirical data alongside qualitative data of questionnaires and â€¨interviews as well as musicological analyses. 
Besides being designed as a tool for providing composers and performers in artistic research processes empirical feedback on how audiovisual materials or performative acts are perceived by the audience, IRMA turned out to be able to deliver empirical groundwork for general aesthetical considerations. In this paper, both approaches towards research and their respective insights are exemplified on the basis of two performances of audiovisual computer music, alongside the insights that resulted from them. Results on the one hand demonstrate how particular artistic concepts have been perceived by the audience, but on the other hand also indicate general insights on perception of audiovisual compositions. IRMA has so far been used and evaluated with 8 computer music performances in 3 concerts.
